                I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched
                C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time... like
                tears in rain... <em>Time to die.</em>

                I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in those last moments he loved life more than he ever had
                before. Not just his life - anybody's life; my life. All he'd wanted were the same answers...
